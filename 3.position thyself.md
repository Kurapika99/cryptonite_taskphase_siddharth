Here's a modified version with some tweaks for variety and clarity:

First, we execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
$ exec /challenge/run
This returns a message instructing us to navigate to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. To do so, we use the cd command to change the working directory:

bash
Copy code
$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
Once in the correct directory, we re-run the execution command:

bash
Copy code
$ exec /challenge/run
