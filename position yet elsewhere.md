Similar to the third challenge, we run the initial command

# $ exec /challenge/run
This outputs a message that tells us we should navigate to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d We run the command to change our current working directory to the specified directory and then run the execution command again.

# $ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
  $ exec /challenge/run
